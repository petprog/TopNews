## Features
* Modular Android App Architecture.
* MVVM Architecture + Repository design Pattern.
* Jetpack Libraries and Architecture Components.
* Kotlin Gradle DSL.


## Modules

Modules are collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide a project into discrete units of functionality. In this case apart from dividing by functionality/responsibility, existing the following dependence between them. The project is divided into 4 Modules :

#### App module

The `:app` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/android-library), which is needed to create the app bundle and some features

#### Core module

The `:core` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) for serving network requests. Providing the data source for the many features that require it.

#### Common module

The `:common` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) only contains code and resources which are shared between feature modules. Reusing this way resources, layouts, views, and components in the different features modules, without the need to duplicate code.

### Project configuration

Add parameters in the locale.properties file as shown in the example below.

```properties
api_key="Your API Key"
```

You can get an Api Key from [NEWS API ORG](https://newsapi.org/)

1. use `apiKey = 2d021085c2e64c23927ff485d9f4299b`
2. Paste copied key into `local.properties` with parameter (`api_key`)
